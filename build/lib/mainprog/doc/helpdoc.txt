1. Script Usage

ASADT scripts version 1.1.0 and above are now located in the '/usr/bin/asadt' directory.
You can either call upon its location or cd into '/usr/bin/asadt' to execute the script.

On most Debian systems, scripts and tools are installed under the '/usr/bin' directory.
The main script now detects if you have the required dependencies and files to run the program.
This function is named 'file-src-chk/apt-src-chk' and it detects what packages you need to install to correctly use the program,
as well as confirms the existance of required program extensions before launch.

To execute ASADT with all the proper permissions, please ensure you execute with the 'sudo' command prior.
Starting the script without sudo permissions may cause the program to fail its pre-inspection functions.

All functions within the main program script "asadt.sh" have been explain at the bottom of the file.
This script is open-source, and no code has been determined as malicious in nature.
To Execute The Script:

1. sudo /usr/bin/asadt/asadt.sh [-h] [-hh] [-v] [--update] [--quickarg] [--cnfedit+arg] [--scantool+arg] [--brutetool+arg] [--exemkr]

2. cd /usr/bin/asadt && sudo ./asadt.sh [-h] [-hh] [-v] [--update] [--quickarg] [--cnfedit+arg] [--scantool+arg] [--brutetool+arg] [--exemkr]

Toolkit Arguments:

    1. ScanTool

    ./asadt.sh --scantool assetfinder
    ./asadt.sh --scantool dmitry
    ./asadt.sh --scantool dnsmap
    ./asadt.sh --scantool nikto
    ./asadt.sh --scantool nmap
    ./asadt.sh --scantool wpscan

    2. BruteTool

    ./asadt.sh --brutetool sqlmap
    ./asadt.sh --brutetool thcssldos

    3. ExeMkr

    ./asadt.sh --exemkr

Configuration Editor Arguments:

    1. CnfEdit

    ./asadt.sh --cnfedit
    ./asadt.sh --cnfedit global
    ./asadt.sh --cnfedit 'toolname'
    ./asadt.sh --cnfedit 'filename'

Main Program Arguments:

    1. Help Command

    ./asadt.sh -h
    ./asadt.sh -hh

    2. Version Command

    ./asadt.sh -v

    3. Update Command

    ./asadt.sh --update

    4. QuickArg Menu

    ./asadt.sh --quickarg



2. Global Settings [NEW]

ASADT script version 1.1.0 and higher now have access to 3 global settings within
the program configuration.

'default_output_location' is used as a global output handler.
setting this will allow the user to output data from all the tools to 1 location.
Please remember that running a tool again in that same location will wipe previous outputted data.

'debug_module' is used as a global switch. Setting this to true will enable debug output
when executing a specific module & script.

'legalagree' is used as a global switch. Setting this to true will accept the startup legal agreement.
Some tools provided in the brutetool may require other legal agreements, these must be accepted on each 
execution.

To edit the global settings using the scripts built in Configuration Editor,
Please refer to [TOC:PAGE:1:SECTION:CONFIGURATIONEDITORARGUMENTS]

Please note:
The global settings are reset to their defaults upon update and must be re-applied.



3. CnfEdit Tool

First released in MARK 2 BETA v1.0.8, this tiny internal program can find and edit
specific tool configuration files to help them work to the user-specific needs.

In version 1.1.0, this command now can edit global settings as well.

Notice: This internal program requires the 'nano' or 'vim' packages to operate.

As of script version 1.1.0, When the user updates the program, they now have the option to utilize the 'configrewind' function.
This function allows the user (say when updating from 1.1.0 --> 1.1.1) to revert their edited configuration files from version
1.1.0, while also applying updates to any files that need such updates.



4. Configuration Help

Every configuration file has 3 different option sections.

1. [ScriptInfo] 2. [ScriptEnablers] 3. [ScriptVariables]

1. [ScriptInfo] is used to inform the displayboxhandler.service of the current module info. DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
2. [ScriptEnablers] are normally true or false and or singular numeric values that are used to enable or disable specific parts of the script.
3. [ScriptVariables] are used to define output filenames or other options, however, do NOT use filenames as a location handler. This Could Cause Damage.

Some scripts with a lot of tool options might come with independent help information inside their ini files.


MainProg InI Files:

[ GLOBAL.INI FILE ]
The 'global.ini' file is used to enable & disable global settings for ASADT, such as the default output location.

[ MAIN.INI FILE ]
The 'main.ini' file is used to inform the program of it's current version for updates, as well as location variables for program libraries and configurations.
It is extremely discouraged to edit any section within this file, doing so may harm your system, and or the program and will require a fresh install.

[ MODULES.INI FILE ]
This 'modules.ini' file is used to help locate the current modules on the system, as well as provide version information for said modules which are important
to determine configuration updates when updating to a newer version. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
